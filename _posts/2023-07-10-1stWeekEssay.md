# Introduction Week II - Playground 

I feel that this week was less busy than the first one, we didn’t have as many meetings, there was less homework, therefore it was also relatively easier. 

The first meeting this week was to teach us about Leadership Teams, a very interesting dynamic here at Encora about communities built on a shared interest. I found it quite inspiring, I hope to get involved in a LT in the near future. 

The next day, we had two meetings that for me personally were very eye opening about how life at Encora is. The first one was the “Regrouping” meeting, where (almost) everyone from Encora MX was present. At first it was amazing to see so many people in a single meeting, and for a moment it was also quite scary, but a few seconds into the meeting, everyone was already joking, playing music and the ambient was so nice and friendly, so even for a newbie like me, it didn’t feel scary anymore, it was like hanging out with friends. I was also a little surprised by the topic discussed in that meeting (the crisis) and was amazed by the incredible response of all the encorians, from the big bosses to even a couple of fellow apprentices that got to ask questions at the meeting. The fact that anyone could participate in the dynamics of the meeting was surprising. It feels nice that everyone here has the chance to speak and be heard. The other meeting was “The art of Feedback”, which I think is a crucial part of the awesome culture experienced here at Encora. 

The next day I had my first “All Hands” meeting, and same as the regrouping, it was awesome to be among so many encorians, chatting and getting to know more about how this place works from the inside. It feels nice, and I would even say “empowering” to be a part of these meetings, you get to feel like you matter, and you are part of the company. 

Last but not least, today we had a little meeting about something called “Viernes de nuevos”, a pretty fun dynamic where we (the newest encorians) get to host a space where we can do some bonding and get to know each other. We are excited for it! 

In this week, we also got access to HyperSkill, and our manager instructed us to start with the “Cinema Room Manager” project. It was fun to do, and it helped me to remember some basic Java concepts.

And that’s been pretty much everything from this last week. I’m really enjoying being a part of Encora MX and look forward to whatever comes next. :D
