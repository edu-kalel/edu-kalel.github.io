# My first week at Encora MX

My week started great, we had our first meeting with Dayra, who oversees our batch of new interns. After we introduced each other, she gave us some instructions for our first assignments, it was a short meeting. After that, we received a mail with more specific instructions to set up our accounts at Outlook, Slack and MyEncora. 

The following days were mostly focused on video calls with different departments at Encora MX. We had meetings with P&C, The Office Managers Team, and a couple of talks with “The IT Jedis”. Each department gave us a warm welcome and explained the work they do and how each one is important for achieving the optimal work conditions found at Encora. Everyone was so nice and friendly! 

Between meetings, I took the courses offered at KnowBe4. All of them were very informative and educational. Even for someone with a little bit of knowledge about topics like cybersecurity and how cyber-attacks tend to be made, all the courses were easy to understand and made their point clear. 

In our last meeting (Orientation Class) we got to know more about what Encora does and the history of the company. I have to admit, it was very interesting and inspirational, it got me even more excited about the program. 

I’m glad I’m here at Encora, eager to learn, work and be a part of the team. 

Already “Feeling the Magic”! ;)
