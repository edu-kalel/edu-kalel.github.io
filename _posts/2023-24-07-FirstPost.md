# THIS BLOG IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. I'LL FINISH IT ASAP. I'M HAVING SOME PROBLEMS WITH JEKYLL AND GITHUB PAGES. APOLOGIES

This 3rd week at Encora was very different from the previous two. For starters, we are having less meetings each week, but the homeworks keep getting more interesting and fun to do. Here's the recap!

## Weekly meetings
To make this recap more efficient and concise, I'll list what I learned from a couple of meetings.
### Performance and Communication
* Do not assume anything
* Being present is important
* Having the full context of a given situation is important
* It's crucial to give feedback, and be open to receive it
* The importance of perception

### Client Intro Workshop
* Is important to be present with the client
* Bonding with the client/team can improve the workflow
* We made an exercise, and with a couple of questions, we got to knew each other better. This lead to a better communication and understanding, which can be applied to the relationship with a client.

## This Week's Homework
This is where the fun began, we had two main assignments for this week:
* Solving problems at Leetcode, both individually and as a team
* Setting up a public blog (The one you are reading as of right now!)

Both of these assignments had their unique challenges, but overall, they were very interesting and fun learning experiences!
### Leetcode
