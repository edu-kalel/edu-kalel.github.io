This 3rd week at Encora was very different from the previous two. For starters, we are having less meetings each week, but the homeworks keep getting more interesting and fun to do. Here's the recap!

## Weekly meetings
To make this recap more efficient and concise, I'll list what I learned from a couple of meetings.
### Performance and Communication
* Do not assume anything
* Being present is important
* Having the full context of a given situation is important
* It's crucial to give feedback, and be open to receive it
* The importance of perception

### Client Intro Workshop
* Is important to be present with the client
* Bonding with the client/team can improve the workflow
* We made an exercise, and with a couple of questions, we got to knew each other better. This lead to a better communication and understanding, which can be applied to the relationship with a client.

## This Week's Homework
This is where the fun began, we had two main assignments for this week:
* Solving problems at Leetcode, both individually and as a team
* Setting up a public blog (The one you are reading as of right now!)

Both of these assignments had their unique challenges, but overall, they were very interesting and fun learning experiences!
### Leetcode
<!-- ```java
CODE code;
``` -->
Personally, I had never used Leetcode before. However, I have used similar platforms, so it was easy to understand.

The problems assigned as a team had a little bit of difficulty, but in my opinion, they were very entertaining to do. As a team, we (the apprentice batch) had a meeting at the beggining of the week to discuss how we were gonna solve those problems. We agreed that each one was going to try a problem, in their language of choice (the options were: Java, Python and TypeScript). I chose the problem "Regular Expression Matching" and, as I'm more familiar with Java, I solved it using said language. You can see the Technical Log Doc in this blog!

The individual problems were very easy. Actually, I got confused, and instead of just solving one, I solve the 3 of them. You can also find the Technical Log Doc for one of those problems in this blog.
### Blog
Now, onto the blog (Yes! this blog!)

We were given options/recommendations for platforms where we could make our public blog. I decided to go with GitHub Pages, as I heard of the tool in the past and had the impression it was a great option. Indeed, GitHub Pages has the tools and facility to create a great Static Website. I also used Jekyll to simplify the build process.

I ran into a couple of problems while setting everything (that's why this blog took so long to be up & running, sorry!) but at the end, I'm very happy with the results, and plan on keep learning and improving this blog!

## Visiting the CDMX Office
This week I also visited the CDMX office... and it did not dissapoint! The experience was great!

Everyone is so friendly and always open to conversation or to give a hand in case you need some help.

I went from tuesday to thursday, and on the last day, we celebrated the birthday of a very important person here at Encora.

I had a great time! The atmosphere is so fun and friendly, while also keeping things professional. I plan on keep going regularly to the office.

Here are some pictures!

# Wrapping up

Overall, this was a week full of new things and experiences. Some were more difficult than others, but I can't deny that I enjoyed all of it.

I'm eager to continue learning, and I'm excited for the future!
