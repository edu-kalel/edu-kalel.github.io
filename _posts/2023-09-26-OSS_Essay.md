## Overview

This marks the 12th week of the apprentice program here at Encora (hard to believe we are **almost** halfway through!) and it has been an incredible journey so far. I've enjoyed every part of it, the learning modules have been deeply interesting (and they keep on getting better), and the community has been incredibly welcoming.

We were also given the opportunity to get certified in AWS, as "associate developers", I've been heavily invested studying for that, but that's a topic to be covered in another post! Let's dive in this last module: _Testing the open-source waters._

## What I learned from this module

### _Getting to know what OSS is about, the why and how people get to work in OSS projects._

It has been amazing to learn about how things get done in an open-source project. As a student and a (hopefully) future developer, oss has been a huge help in my learning path for years now. From entertainment, up to academic purposes, this types of projects improve the quality of life of thousands of people around the world, sometimes without they even knowing.

Open-source software refers to computer programs whose source code is made available to the public, allowing anyone to view, modify, and distribute the code. The core principles of OSS are transparency, collaboration, and community-driven development.

In a way, I feel like contributing to open-source projects is our way to "give back" to the community, and is a great opportunity to learn new topics and sharpen our skills.

From what I gathered, people often contribute to oss for reasons like:

* Passion and Interest
<!-- : Many OSS contributors are passionate about technology and specific software. They contribute because they genuinely enjoy working on it. -->

* Skill Development
<!-- : Contributing to OSS allows developers to hone their skills and gain real-world experience, which can be valuable in their careers. -->

* Solving Real-world Problems
<!-- : OSS often addresses real-world challenges. Contributors are motivated by the opportunity to solve problems and create software that benefits others. -->

* Community and Collaboration
<!-- : Being part of an OSS community offers a sense of belonging and the opportunity to collaborate with like-minded individuals from around the world. -->

* Contributing to a Cause
<!-- : Some people are driven by ideological reasons, believing in the principles of open access, transparency, and freedom of software. -->

* Career Opportunities
<!-- : Many companies value contributions to OSS, and it can enhance an individual's resume and career prospects. -->


### _Learning about the OSS workflow, how do people organize, collaborate and communicate to make it happen._

One thing I've been loving about OSS is the community aspect of it. Successful OSS projects often focus on building a strong and inclusive community. This involves welcoming new contributors, recognizing their efforts, and providing mentorship. Community building ensures the long-term sustainability of the project.

I found it rather easy to be part of an open-source project, but I learned there are important things to keep in mind while choosing a project to contribute:
* Licensing and Legal Compliance:

    OSS projects typically have clear licensing terms to protect contributors and users. Contributors must understand and adhere to the project's chosen license. Legal issues, such as copyright and trademark compliance, are taken seriously.
    
* Contribution guidelines

    Contribution guidelines are a crucial component of open-source software (OSS) projects. They provide clear instructions and expectations for individuals who want to contribute to the project, ensuring that contributions are consistent, well-structured, and aligned with the project's goals. 

## My first PR
One of the main assignments of this module was to make a PR to a simple issue (like fixing a typo or adding a tranlsation).

Turns out, as easy as it is to contribute to a project, the hard part comes before it. The process of **finding** a project is way harder than I thought. And after finding the project, we must learn about it, and at least understand how the code works. Also, as I mentioned before, it is important to check if it has an Open Source license, and read the contributions guidelines (the last thing we want to do is to make things worse).

At the end, as the main objective was to practice the process of getting a PR for the first time, I followed the steps detailed in the [first-contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) repo. This project aims to simplify and guide the way beginners make their first contribution. It was a helpful exercise to learn all about making a contribution to a repo, from forking the project, all the way to making the Pull Request.

## Possible issues to work in through the next weeks

After reviewing the document with the recommended projects to contribute to, I've chosen the next issues:

[Show endpoint URL in reconciliation service list](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/5878)

[Escape character for fields name when exporting in SQL](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/4716)

Both issues are from the [OpenRefine](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine) repo.

## Wrapping up

That's it for now! I will be updating this blog when the PRs to the OpenRefine repo are done :D
